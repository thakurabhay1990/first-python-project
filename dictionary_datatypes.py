# Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form.
# It is similar to the hash table type.
# Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value.
# It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.


dictionary = {"a":2, 5:"abhay", "c":"Hi Everyone"}
print(dictionary)
print(dictionary["a"])
print(dictionary[5])
print(dictionary["c"])


# Suppose you want to build dictionary from an empty dictionary
dict = {}
dict["first_name"] = "Ambika"
dict["last_name"] = "Thakur"
dict[2] = "QA Test"

print(dict)
print(dict[2])
